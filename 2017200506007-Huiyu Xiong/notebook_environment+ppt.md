### Subject: The Requirements of Environment

#### Date: <u>April 13</u>   Author: <u>Huiyu Xiong</u>

##### Purpose: 

Make clear the requirements of setting up environment and find out what models we need to build in the world.

##### Procedure:

Browse the courseware and MS team messages given by the teacher. Sort out and summarize the outline of exchange.

##### Experiment:

- Max.Size for robot: 50cm * 50cm
- From start, you can draw some leading lines so that the robot can follow; there is an orange beacon or box on the edge of the pond, where fish will be fed
- Bridge: 100cm wide * 3M long, including ramps for up and down the bridge
- After crossing the bridge, there are several trees scattered randomly, which need to be avoided and turned right
- The arch should be slightly larger than the robot. The recommended size of arch is 100cm (W) x 100cm (H)
- Find the arch, cross it, and follow the line on the ground. Arches can be found on the ground with signs or beacons
- The middle of the bridge will line up with the edge of the pond, you should find the bridge and go through it, then find the tree and right
- After passing the arch, follow the line of the ground and turn right to avoid colliding with the trees
- The robot should move to the color box
- After the robot reads the color of the box, the robot should be able to follow the correct color until it reaches finish. You can set colors manually or automatically using the random color generator

##### Results:

From the above outline, we can intuitively find all models that need to be built in the world. The details covered include not only dimensional requirements but also location information. Make our subsequent environment more accurate and meet customer needs.
