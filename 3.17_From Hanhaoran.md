- ### introduction

This experiment mainly introduce how to set the **camera** connector of the RaspberryPi. Moreover, how to install `opencv-python` in to the raspberry is also intruceded.

## Experiment Procedure

In 2020/3/17, because of the inapproprate usage of the connector, the port of the camera is broken. In that case, my RaspberryPi cannot find any camera setting even though i connect my camera to it. The damage of the port is shown as:

## Expeiment Procedure

In 2020/3/17, my new camera comes to me. I bought two camera with different connection. One is USB, one is CSI.

1. After I connect the camera with a CSI connection to the RaspberryPi, it still cannot recognized this divice. Open the command line, type in `sudo raspi-config`, go to the Interfacing Options, enable Camera、Serial、Remote GPIO. If you do not enable Camera operation, RaspberryPi cannot recognize your device.
2. Following Song's work, I donwload the `.whl` file [opencv-contrib-python-4.1.0.25](https://www.piwheels.org/simple/opencv-contrib-python/opencv_contrib_python-4.1.0.25-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl) into my laptop first. Then this file is transmitted to the Desktop of my Raspberry.
3. Typing `pip install /home/pi/Desktop/opencv_contrib_python-4.1.0.25-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl` in the cammand line and the the downloading will finish very soon.
4. from now on, we could import moudle `cv2` in our `.py` file.

However, my Raspberry could only recognized the camera which is connected via **USB port**. Even though the Raspberry could use the camera conneted via CSI port, the cv2 moudle could use it.

- Solution: typing `sudo nano /etc/modules` first, add a line of `bcm2835-v4l2`  (lower case of L) at the end of the file. Save the file. Reboot the file.

then, we could find two of the camera could be used.





here is my finall test code:

```python
![DoubelCamera](\DoubelCamera.PNG)import cv2

cap0 = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
ret0, frame0 = cap0.read()
frame0 = cv2.flip(frame0, 0)

cap1 = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
ret1, frame1 = cap1.read()
frame1 = cv2.flip(frame1, 0)

while (cap0.isOpened() and cap1.isOpened()):    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):        
        break    
    ret0, frame0 = cap0.read()    
    frame0 = cv2.flip(frame0, 1)    
    cv2.imshow('frame0', frame0)    
    ret1, frame1 = cap1.read()    
    frame1 = cv2.flip(frame1, 1)    
    cv2.imshow('frame1',frame1)

cap0.release()
cap1.release()
cv2.destoryAllWindows()
```

the result is as follows:
