## Overview

**Notebook** is very important for experiment. There are many requirements for notebook, so we need to pay attention to how to write a notebook. The reference Chinese website is [here](https://www.biomart.cn/experiment/430/599/627/205672.htm).


## Brief of Notebook

### :clipboard: Outline

- The first page of the notebook is the **title page**: all persons recorded on the notebook must also sign the title page and give examples of abbreviations used:
``` markdown
***Laboratory Record***

Patterns of Myosin Light Chain Isoenzymes in Developing Chick Skeletal Muscle 
David R. Caprette
Department of Biochemistry & Cell Biology
Rice University
211A Anderson Biology Lab
6100 S. Main
Houston, Texas 77005
```

- **Table of contents**: record the number of the first page of each experiment (here we record `the experiment link`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Following is what you need to fill out every time you record a notebook:


- **Date**  (date + environmental conditions)
- **Experiment Title**
- **Experiment Objective or Purpose**
- **Experimental Materials & Instruments**
- **Experiment Plan or flow chart**
- **Experimental Method & Step-by-step Procedure**
- **Raw Data**
- **Experimental Results** (including charts, tables, graphs, photographs and / or drawings)
- **Experimental conclusion** (including the concept involved, whether to achieve the goal, any problems encountered and suggestions for future experiments) 




### :warning: Note

* In the later stage, do not delete the previous record. When it needs to be modified, use ~~underline~~ to remove it. Record justification for correction / editing. `Circle` the reason and add the date abbreviation & your name to the corrected / edited data
* Update table of contents
* Written in the first person: I chose these two components…
* Own signature & date + witness's signature & date
* If the program or other information is copied from a source, the source must be identified in the lab notebook
* One page can cover more than one day's activities, and each activity must be dated



### :page_facing_up: Coverage

* Experimental outline & practical plan
* Records of important materials and equipment
* Observation, actual occurrence
* Unexpected results and observations
* Sketches and photos
* "Link" to other people's notes or instrument logs, disk data
* innovate
* Draw some charts
* Abstracts of papers read
* Tips, important things, implicit information
* data
* Future plans and potential uses
* All measurement and important test conditions (weight, volume, temperature, etc.)
* All units




### :triangular_ruler: Data Record

*Calculated data*： based on the calculation or statistical evaluation of the raw data
*Transcribed data*： copied raw or calculated data; should indicate "exact copy of raw data" or location of raw data



**DATA**

- Indicate whether the number is estimated, not measured
- Indicate if these figures have been calculated and provide equations
- If excel is used, print out the formula
- Indicates whether the number is rounded or truncated

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RECORD**

- Clear (including drawings and flow charts), detailed, so that others in your discipline can understand and repeat
- Clear definition of abbreviations
- Only input in the rule area of linked file, and can't use other file
- Two experiments cannot be placed on the same file
- Attach forms or printouts (signed and dated along the edges)
- Record data on the day of generation, not afterwards
- The recorded person must sign on the page
